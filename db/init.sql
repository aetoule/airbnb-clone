'This modern condo is completely remodeled offering all the amenities you may want or need for a comfortable stay - no matter how long with a central location near popular places like the airport, convention center, and sports arenas or hiking and lots of restaurants.

Watch Netflix and cable (Sling) via Roku - should be all logged in already, fast Wi-Fi internet, full kitchen + equipment (toaster oven - no microwave - the food is really better when it''s not nuked, washer and dryer.

With a comfortable queen bed in each bedroom, there is ample room for up to four people. Pretty much all that you''ll need is provided: towels, soaps, shampoo and even a hair dryer and clothes iron.

Tea and coffee for the french press are provided. The frig. has some basic condiments like ketchup, sriracha, mustard plus basic spices plus a bottled water and usually a few bottles of beer.

This is our second condo. Our other one has great reviews from guests. When preparing this one for you, we aimed to meet and exceed the comfort of the other condo. Our goal is to make that kind of place we would enjoy staying in and returning to.

The condo is about 950 square feet - third party measurement.

This is a small community of only four condos that share a large green yard with a sitting area in the middle where you can enjoy the weather, read a book, have coffee or just lounge around.

If you''re here in the winter it may be just in time to have an orange or tangelo from one of the citrus trees.

The entire place is yours. The condo is completely stocked so you can be the chef if you want, make coffee in the French press or just warm up that take out.

Access to the condo is through a lockbox. This is easy to use and allows you to get in whenever you arrive, but, if you want, we''ll be happy to meet you: it''s your choice.',
'You can use pretty much everything in the condo, it''s there to make your stay comfortable.

The kitchen has utensils, plates, cups, glasses and a set of pots and pans: get creative or just warm up food in the oven or toaster oven.

Extra linens and toiletries are in the hall closet. Anything in the frig. is there for your use.

The laundry is just outside in the grey laundry room by the front door - access it with the sa
me key as the entry doors.',

Third Sleeping Area - on couch in living room - if needed.

Sleeping arrangement in the living room. An additional person may sleep on the sofa. It is very comfortable for someone up to about 5 foot 9 inches tall. The large pillows come off and it''s like a twin bed (73 long by 33 wide).

FYI: We wash ALL bedding - ALL OF IT - every single time - even the comforter cover(s) - WITHOUT EXCEPTION. This is what we would expect and that is what we provide. I take pride in cleanliness - it is no. 1 on my list.',

-- 37	Cathedral Rock Belle-Luxury Glamping on Oak Creek	150	2	There simply is not a more magical or beloved place in all of Sedona. While this spot has visitors during the day and our family lives on the property, you get the unique experience of evenings here alone at the creek with the moon, stars & Cathedral Rock. The mornings are truly glorious. We have an elegant Lotus Belle set up just for you, with a king size organic mattress and your own outdoor bathroom. Our hope is that you can relax into the beauty and magic of this deeply sacred place.	Cathedral Rock is one of the most powerful vortex spots in Sedona, and this place here on Oak Creek with the view of Cathedral Rock, called Red Rock Crossing, is perhaps the most famous place in all of Sedona. There is only one property right on the creek with the direct view of Cathedral Rock - and this is it. The view from our back yard is the most photographed image in all of the American Southwest. This is where people come to get married, to pray, to be in contemplation, and to rest deeply in the beauty and majesty of the Earth. I am the newest stewardess of this land, and love this place with all my heart. It is my honor and joy to share this extraordinary, exquisite land with you. We ask that those who come refrain from loud music or any excessive drinking, and to join us in respecting the sanctity of this land.	You have access to your Lotus Bell and the outdoor bathroom. The bathroom is private with views of trees and has a retractable awning to keep out rain or snow. It is VERY IMPORTANT that only toilet paper goes in the toilet. We have a super sensitive septic system. We have a small trashcan for any feminine products etc.\n\nWe do not have a kitchen for your use, however we do provide a small cooler for you to keep items in for your own use. (We ask that you please clean it out entirely when you leave.) Note: it's Sedona so there are javalinas. We recommend NOT leaving food out. We do provide water, tea, tea kettle, and a small tea table. You can park in our house driveway. Food and restaurants are very nearby in town and I provide a complete list of all my recommendations.	We live in a section of the main house on the property (the rest of the house awaits renovation. It's an old house that we bought with the land, and it needs a lot of love. Our Belle is our way of sharing this gorgeous spot and the absolutely magic of being here while prepare to rebuild:) We have an awesome four year old boy. We are out and about on the land in the mornings after 7:30am and before dinnertime, but otherwise, it's pretty quiet. We will leave you to your own space unless you would like to interact with us.	A Lotus Belle is "glamping" tent:) Because it gets cold in the evenings, we have special insulation in the cooler months to keep you warm, along with duvet and blankets, a heated blanket, and an electric fireplace. In the summer months, we provide a fan.\n\nAlso of high importance - do not spray ANY perfume, bug spray or light incense in the Belle. The fumes stick around and are very hard to get rid of. This could cause health issues for other guests.\n\nWe provide detailed instructions on how to make your stay in the Lotus Belle cozy and comfortable. Check out the Guest Manual here on Airbnb when you book. We also have a small manual in the Belle.\n\nAlso, there is no cell coverage unless you have Verizon (and even that is a little choppy.) We DO have wifi and will provide you with that password. We turn it off every night at 9:15pm and turn it back on around 8:30am every morning.	333 Red Rock Crossing Rd, Sedona, AZ 86336	Sedona	1
